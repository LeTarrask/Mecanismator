Mecanismator is almost entirely cloned from Lauren Orsini’s <a href="https://github.com/laurenorsini/caaaaarbs">Caaaaarbs</a>, which is is a stupid joke Chrome extension about her editor, Owen Thomas, who follows the Paleo diet. 

Caaaaarbs is nearly 100% cloned from Steven Frank's <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt">Cloud To Butt</a>, with his permission. Thanks for helping me do something even stupider!
